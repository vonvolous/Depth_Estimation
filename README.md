## ⚙️ Setup

Assuming a fresh [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, you can install the dependencies with:
```shell
conda install pytorch=0.4.1 torchvision=0.2.1 -c pytorch
pip install tensorboardX==1.4
conda install opencv=3.3.1   # just needed for evaluation
```
We ran our experiments with PyTorch 0.4.1, CUDA 9.1, Python 3.6.6 and Ubuntu 18.04.
We have also successfully trained models with PyTorch 1.0, and our code is compatible with Python 2.7. You may have issues installing OpenCV version 3.3.1 if you use Python 3.7, we recommend to create a virtual environment with Python 3.6.6 `conda create -n monodepth2 python=3.6.6 anaconda `.

<!-- We recommend using a [conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to avoid dependency conflicts.

We also recommend using `pillow-simd` instead of `pillow` for faster image preprocessing in the dataloaders. -->


## 🖼️ Prediction for a single image

You can predict scaled disparity for a single image with:

```shell
python test_simple.py --image_path assets/test_image.jpg --model_name mono+stereo_640x192
```

or, if you are using a stereo-trained model, you can estimate metric depth with

```shell
python test_simple.py --image_path assets/test_image.jpg --model_name mono+stereo_640x192 --pred_metric_depth
```

**Splits**

The train/test/validation splits are defined in the `splits/` folder.
By default, the code will train a depth model using [Zhou's subset](https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner) of the standard Eigen split of KITTI, which is designed for monocular training.
You can also train a model using the new [benchmark split](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction) or the [odometry split](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) by setting the `--split` flag.


**Custom dataset**

You can train on a custom monocular or stereo dataset by writing a new dataloader class which inherits from `MonoDataset` – see the `KITTIDataset` class in `datasets/kitti_dataset.py` for an example.


## ⏳ Training

By default models and tensorboard event files are saved to `~/tmp/<model_name>`.
This can be changed with the `--log_dir` flag.


**Monocular training:**
```shell
python train.py --model_name mono_model
```

**Stereo training:**

Our code defaults to using Zhou's subsampled Eigen training data. For stereo-only training we have to specify that we want to use the full Eigen training set – see paper for details.
```shell
python train.py --model_name stereo_model \
  --frame_ids 0 --use_stereo --split eigen_full
```

**Monocular + stereo training:**
```shell
python train.py --model_name mono+stereo_model \
  --frame_ids 0 -1 1 --use_stereo
```


### GPUs

The code can only be run on a single GPU.
You can specify which GPU to use with the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python train.py --model_name mono_model
```

All our experiments were performed on a single NVIDIA Titan Xp.

| Training modality | Approximate GPU memory  | Approximate training time   |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mono              | 9GB                     | 12 hours                    |
| Stereo            | 6GB                     | 8 hours                     |
| Mono + Stereo     | 11GB                    | 15 hours                    |



### 💽 Finetuning a pretrained model

Add the following to the training command to load an existing model for finetuning:
```shell
python train.py --model_name finetuned_mono --load_weights_folder ~/tmp/mono_model/models/weights_19
```

### 🔧 Other training options

Run `python train.py -h` (or look at `options.py`) to see the range of other training options, such as learning rates and ablation settings.
